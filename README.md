* IF ANY DAMAGE IS CAUSED BECAUSE OF USE BY MY OPTIMIZATION GUIDE AND PACK I AM NOT RELIABLE FOR YOUR INABILITY TO RESEARCH. THAT IS YOUR FAULT NOT MINE.
* REASEARCH AND READ THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT EVERY TWEAK WILL DO.
* IF YOUR LAZINESS OR INCOMPETENCE RESULTS IN A BSOD BECAUSE YOU RAN MY TWEAKS BESIDES ANOTHER POORLY CODED BATCH FILE THAT IS YOUR OWN FAULT NOT MINE, AND NOT ANYONE ELSES.
